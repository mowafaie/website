      <p style="font-size:xx-large; text-align:start; margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 10%">Hello, my name is Muhammad Wafaie. I am currently 14 years old, a student entering grade 9 in Dar El Tarbiah School, and an athlete. I am from Cairo, Egypt. I play 4 sports: <strong>Basketball, Football, Archery, and Boxing</strong>. Among all these four sports, Basketball is my favorite because I have been training since I was 8. I play as a shooting guard in Basketball. In Football, I play as a <em>striker</em> in the academy and I play for fun.
       I started playing Archery last year because I think I can be talented in that sport and to win tournements. I also joined Boxing recently to learn to be tough and to have good stamina. There is a sport that I used to play, Squash, 
       I did not really like this sport but I played it because my dad and my grandfather used to played it and they wanted me to play it.

        <ul>\

            <li style="font-size:xx-large;margin-bottom: 2%;margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 10%">Basketball: As I said before, is my favorite sport because it's so fun and I really one day hope to be a professional basketballer like my idol Stephen Curry. I trained basketball 
                in one club,  <strong>Shooting Club. </strong>Last year, my team and I won third place in Giza Basketball zone.

                Football: I joined the Football academy because I love Football very much and I wanted to learn how to play Football so that I can play with my friends, my family, and others. 
                 The greatest footballer in my opinion is <em>the GOAT Messi.</em>

            <li style="font-size:xx-large; margin-top: 2%;margin-bottom: 2%; margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 10%">

                Archery: Archery, I think, is the sport that I might have a future about. When I had my first training, coaches said I have really good potential in the sport and I might be
                one of the best players in the world. The coaches knew me from my older brothers because they were professionals and won many medals.

                Boxing: I don't train real Ioxing like I don't fight people, I only train Boxing to be strong and to have great stamina and to be tough in life.
